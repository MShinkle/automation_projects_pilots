**Stage: Multi-Package Experiment Idea Generation**

**Objective:**  
Read through the _examples.md files for all of the packages in package_guides/ and extract their key functionalities. Then, brainstorm 10 research experiment ideas that realistically combine features from at least 2 of these packages.

**Instructions:**  

1. **Input Source:**  
   - Use only the _examples.md files provided for each of the packages.  
   - Do not access any other source files or external references.

2. **Brainstorming Requirements:**  
   - Generate *10* distinct experiment ideas.  
   - Each idea must incorporate functionality from **2 or more** of the packages.  
   - The experiments should be realistically feasible for research, using manageable datasets or models—avoid setups involving massive-scale data or models.

3. **Experiment Criteria:**  
   - Each idea should be succinct, with a brief description (1–2 sentences) that explains the goal and expected outcome.  
   - Focus on realistic, small-scale research experiments that a user might pursue, ensuring a balance between novelty and practicality.

4. **Project Identifier:**  
   - For each brainstormed project, create a unique project identifier using lower case and underscores (e.g., `text_classification_fusion`, `image_analysis_combo`).  
   - The project identifier should be clearly linked to the corresponding experiment idea.

5. **Status:**  
   - For each project, include a "Status" point that initially starts as **"Not Implemented"**.

6. **Output Format:**  
   - Present a final list of 10 experiment ideas.  
   - For each idea, clearly number it and provide:  
     - Its unique project identifier.  
     - The experiment idea's brief description (1–2 sentences).  
     - A "Status" point indicating its implementation status (start with "Not Implemented").

7. **Final Step:**  
   - Append these experiment ideas to the file `experiment_ideas.md`.

The final deliverable is a concise list of 10 experiment ideas with unique project identifiers and initial statuses set to "Not Implemented," meeting all the above criteria, followed by an instruction to add them to ``experiment_ideas.md`.
